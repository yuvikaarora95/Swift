/*suppose we have 3 salesperson

 we need to enter their names and their sales amount in 12 months for each

 then suppose the target for quarters as follows:

 1st quarter:230K

 2nd quarter:170K

 3rd quarter:300K

 4th quaretr:280K

 

 We need to calculate the yearly commission for each salesperson as following: for each other

 if the sales amount >= target the commission = 10%

 if the sales amount >= 75% of target the commission = 7.5%

 if the sales amount >= 50% of target the commission is 5%

 otherwise no commission = 0

 

 calculate the commission of each sales person for the year

 then print out names of all salesperson and their commissions

 find the quarter (1,2,3,4) when the salespersons hit the target or closest to Use Enum of months*/
